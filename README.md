The integrations made for the application are using Lottie, an AirBnB framework for animations, thingspeak, a IOT backend. The application is capable of projecting and understanding data in realtime setting up successful communication via the front end to the backend and to the hardware.

Following are the features of the application:

1. Can connect to the IoT device via JSON data fetching through a URL.
2. Fetches the latest value of the temperature and displays it on an animated thermometer.
3. Maps the location of the temperature changers on hte jacket and animates it.
